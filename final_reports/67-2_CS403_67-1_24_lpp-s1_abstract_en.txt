The traditional process presented several limitations, including inconvenience for students due to a multi-step survey completion process and a low number of responses received, primarily attributable to inefficient dissemination. Consequently, the evaluation results may not genuinely reflect student needs. Developing TU Surveyor aims to mitigate these issues by utilizing LINE, a widely used application in Thailand, to create a more efficient and user-friendly survey system. The developed TU Surveyor survey system will enable students to access and complete surveys more easily through LINE chat notifications via LINE OA. This system is expected not only to simplify the survey response process but also to improve the accuracy and efficiency of data collection. The collected data will subsequently be utilized to enhance the quality of education and build trust in educational quality assurance process.
